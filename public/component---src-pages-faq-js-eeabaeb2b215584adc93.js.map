Vegan and vegetarian-specific restaurants are tagged as\n          such.

If a listing piques your\n          interest, follow your heart into the wilds of the Greater Internet in\n          search of more specifics: business hours, menus, and, most\n          importantly, blurry photos of tofu curry.

In general we have tried to stay\n          budget-conscious, while appreciating that everybody has their own tour\n          budget that works for them.\n          <br />\n          <br />\n          <span style={{ fontFamily: \"BrandonGrotesqueBold\" }}>\n            Why do some listings have notes?\n          </span>\n          <br />\n          Many places have suggested dishes or other relevant notes, and our\n          hope is to provide those insightful details as much as possible.
