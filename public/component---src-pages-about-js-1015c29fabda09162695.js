Over years of touring across the country, we have been lucky to experience and appreciate America’s diversity through its food, and want to share our rolodex with anyone interested. Our ever-evolving lists of restaurants, bakeries, and cafes are non-hierarchical: there are no listicles, rankings, or any “best of” content. The information we give you is lean but meaningful. It’s like asking a friend where to eat in ","{","x","}"," town and they text back “you should go to ","{","x","}",".” But in this scenario, we’re your friend. Or rather, the many touring musicians who have contributed to this database are your friends. And what makes us different than Joe Schmo on Yelp is that we’ve eaten pizza in enough cities to know whether the best pizza in Norman, Oklahoma is actually worth your time or if there’s something more special worth pursuing. No offense to Joe. Or that pizza place in Norman. Our main goal is functionality: you’re on tour, you’re in a new or unfamiliar city or town, you don’t know anybody there, and you want to know what to eat. You come to this website and realize you’re not alone anymore. Other people have been here before you, and they have places to recommend.
