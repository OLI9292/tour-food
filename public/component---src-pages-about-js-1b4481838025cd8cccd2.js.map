After years of expansion, we decided it was time to turn\n          “the spreadsheet” into an easily navigable, functional website. We\n          painstakingly checked, sorted, and tagged each listing, cursing\n          whoever added a Chick-Fil-A in Idaho and praising the genius who found\n          the family-owned gas station in Wyoming that serves outstanding Indian\n          food.\n          <br />\n          <br />\n          The refreshed and refined spreadsheet is now the heart and soul of\n          this website: a public, shared space where all types of traveling\n          folks can benefit from the wisdom of musicians whose touring\n          highlights sometimes include more delicious meals than well-attended\n          performances. We only play for about an hour each night. But during\n          the other 23, we’re eating or thinking about eating.\n        </Text>\n\n        <Header\n          style={{ textAlign: \"center\", marginTop: \"25px\", padding: \"50px\" }}\n          color={colors.blue}\n        >\n          HOW IS THIS DIFFERENT FROM OTHER FOOD WEBSITES?\n        </Header>\n\n        <Text\n          small\n          color={colors.blue}\n          style={{\n            padding: \"25px 50px\",\n            fontFamily: \"BrandonGrotesqueLight\",\n            maxWidth: \"900px\",\n            margin: \"0 auto\",\n          }}\n        >\n          Our criteria are simple: quality, value (roughly $20 or less for a\n          meal), and whenever possible, regionality– something that can be\n          elusive on tour. Over years of touring across the country, we have\n          been lucky to experience and appreciate America’s diversity through\n          its food, and want to share our rolodex with anyone interested. Our\n          ever-evolving lists of restaurants, bakeries, and cafes are\n          non-hierarchical: there are no listicles, rankings, or any “best of”\n          content. The information we give you is lean but meaningful. It’s like\n          asking a friend where to eat in {\"{\"}x{\"}\"} town and they text back\n          “you should go to {\"{\"}x{\"}\"}.” But in this scenario, we’re your\n          friend. Or rather, the many touring musicians who have contributed to\n          this database are your friends. And what makes us different than Joe\n          Schmo on Yelp is that we’ve eaten pizza in enough cities to know\n          whether the best pizza in Norman, Oklahoma is actually worth your time\n          or if there’s something more special worth pursuing. No offense to\n          Joe. Or that pizza place in Norman. Our main goal is functionality:\n          you’re on tour, you’re in a new or unfamiliar city or town, you don’t\n          know anybody there, and you want to know what to eat. You come to this\n          website and realize you’re not alone anymore. Other people have been\n          here before you, and they have places to recommend. You’re going to\n          have a great meal.\n        </Text>\n\n        <Header\n          style={{ textAlign: \"center\", marginTop: \"25px\" }}\n          color={colors.blue}\n        >\n          made by\n        </Header>\n\n        <Text\n          small\n          color={colors.blue}\n          style={{\n            padding: \"25px 50px\",\n            fontFamily: \"BrandonGrotesqueLight\",\n            maxWidth: \"900px\",\n            margin: \"0 auto\",\n          }}\n        >\n          <span style={{ fontSize: \"1.2em\", fontFamily: \"BrandonGrotesque\" }}>\n            Luke Pyenson\n          </span>\n          <br />\n          <br />\n          Luke plays drums in the indie rock band Frankie Cosmos and contributes\n          food and travel articles and recipes to publications including Saveur,\n          The Boston Globe, The Washington Post, Edible Boston, and more. He has\n          been touring on-and-off since 2010 and full-time since 2016. He has\n          been writing about food professionally since 2007, and spent formative\n          years working part-time in Boston-area restaurant kitchens. He has an\n          MA in the Anthropology of Travel, Tourism, and Pilgrimage, which is a\n          subject area that directly relates to this website.

Charlie met Adam in 2006 and the two have covered thousands of\n          miles together, touring and eating all across the U.S. in their\n          matching Toyota Sienna minivans. Charlie met Luke in 2019 when Adam\n          realized his friends' mutual love for ice cream and cooking, and\n          thought they would make a good Tour Food team. Charlie loves cooking\n          with immigrant grandmas and his favorite listing on Tour Food is\n          Snow's BBQ in Lexington, TX.\n          <br />\n          <br />\n          <br />\n          <span style={{ fontSize: \"1.2em\", fontFamily: \"BrandonGrotesque\" }}>\n            Adam Schatz\n          </span>\n          <br />\n          <br />\n          Adam writes and releases songs with his band Landlady and plays\n          keyboards and saxophone with lots of other fun folks including This Is\n          The Kit and Japanese Breakfast.

In the\n          kitchen he has fallen off the deep end with baking sourdough bread and\n          a developing signature donut recipe.
